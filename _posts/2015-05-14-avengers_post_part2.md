title: When Iron Man becomes reactive, RxJava
---

This part of the series is focused on the benefits that some funcional touches can provide a to our projects. 

A framework like `RxJava` of [ReactiveX] can easily help to handle different running environments running on tasks in background or in the UI thread. On android that has always been a nightmare for all us.

This article also focuses on how the operators can minimize the time in common development tasks, [Reactive Extensions](http://reactivex.io/) offers a wide range of operators to make your live easier.

As always, most of the code and snippets are uploaded to Github, feel free to comment, open an issue or complaining!.

In the [first part](http://saulmm.github.io/when-Thor-and-Hulk-meet-dagger2-rxjava-1/) of this series we talked about [Dagger 2](http://google.github.io/dagger/), as we go forward we'll see as the coupling between our layers will be less and increase scalability.

## RetroLambda

Sometimes, in huge applications developed in Java, or large frameworks like android, it's really difficult or even impossible (android) to use features from Java 8 like the [Lambda expressions](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/lambdaexpressions.html).

[Retrolambda] it's a _Backport_ that comes to solve this problem, translating the Java 8 bytecode to previous Java versions like the v7, or even v5 or v6, allowing us to use _Lambda_ among other features.

![](http://androcode.es/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/retrolambda.png)

[Retrolambda] can be used with the Gradle plugin or Maven, I've choosen Gradle that comes for free in Android Studio, to use it you only have to add the [Retrolambda] plugin on the root `build.gradle` and apply it in your module `build.gradle`, setting the language level of Android Studio to **1.8** all it's done.

_build.gradle_ (root)

```javascript
    dependencies {
        classpath 'me.tatarka:gradle-retrolambda:3.1.0'
```

_{your module}/build.gradle_

```javascript

    apply plugin: 'me.tatarka.retrolambda'

    android { 

        ...

        compileOptions {
            sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
            targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        }
    }
}
```

[RetroLambda] allows you to write less boilerplate code, also clarifies our code making it more readable. In this example by [Dan Lew](http://blog.danlew.net/2014/09/15/grokking-rxjava-part-1/), you can taste the diference.

_Without RetroLambda_

```java
Observable.just("Hello, world!")
    .subscribe(new Action1<String>() {
        @Override
        public void call(String s) {
              System.out.println(s);
        }
    });
```

_With RetroLambda_

```java
Observable.just("Hello, world!") .subscribe(
    s -> System.out.println(s)
);
```

_In the Avengers example_

```java
mCharacterSubscription = mGetCharacterInformationUsecase
    .execute().subscribe(
        character -> onAvengerReceived(character),
        error     -> manageError(error)
    );

mComicsSubscription = mGetCharacterComicsUsecase
    .execute().subscribe(
        comics -> Observable.from(comics).subscribe(
            comic -> onComicReceived(comic)),
        error  -> manageError(throwable)
    );
```

## ReactiveX

[ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io/) is a collection of Open Source projects among their main principles are the [Observer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern) pattern, the pattern [Iterator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterator_pattern#Java) and the functional programming.

[ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io/) it's also defined as an API for asynchronous programming, in fact it's really easy to implement asynchronous task with these frameworks.

<br>
## ReactiveX as an asynchronous client

The great thing about dealing with [ReactiveX] is that you can create a fully asynchronous API or client, and then in the implementation decide whether the code will be treated asynchronously or in a separate `Thread` a `Threadpool` or synchronously.

So we have an observable API rather than a blocking API.

```java
public interface Usecase<T> {

    Observable<T> execute();
}
```


```java
public interface Repository {

    Observable<Character> getCharacter (final int characterId);

    Observable<List<Comic>> getCharacterComics (final int characterId);
}
```

<br>
## What is RxJava

[RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) is an implementation of the [Reactive Extensions](https://github.com/ReactiveX) made by **Netflix**. There are implementations for the vast majority of programming languages including Javascript, Python, Ruby, Go and many more.

<br>
## Observables & Observers

An `Observable` emits an object or series of objects, these objects are consumed or received by the `Observer` subscribed to the 'Observable'.
<br>

![](http://androcode.es/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/observable-observer2.png)
<br>
Is necessary that an `Observer` has to be registered into an `Observable`, if not the `Observer` won't emit anything. When the `Observer` is registered, an object of the type `Subscription` is created, which is used to unsubscribe from the `Observable`, this is useful for `Activities` and `Fragments` on the `onStop` or `onPause` methods, for example.

```java
mCharacterSubscription = mGetCharacterInformationUsecase
    .execute().subscribe( ... );
            
```


```java
@Override
public void onStop() {

    if (!mCharacterSubscription.isUnsubscribed())
        mCharacterSubscription.unsubscribe();

    if (!mComicsSubscription.isUnsubscribed())
        mComicsSubscription.unsubscribe();
}
```

Whenever an `Observer` subscribes to an `Observable` has to take into account three methods.

- `onNext (T)` method to receive objects issued by the 'Observable'
- `onError (Exception)`, the method that will be called when there is some kind of error
- `onCompleted()`, method to be called when the `Observable` finished emitting objects.

<br>
## Communicating components

Let's take a look at how to use the `GetCharacterInformationUsecase` usecase.
All usecases implement the interface `Usecase <T>`:

```java
public interface Usecase<T> {

    Observable<T> execute();
}
```

When a usecase is run this return an object of the type `Observable`, this is useful to be able to chain observables & operators with the least effort, we will see the great power that these operators soon.

When we run the `GetCharacterInformationUsecase` we say to our repository to make a request to our corresponding data source:

```java
@Override
public Observable<Character> execute() {

    return mRepository.getCharacter(mCharacterId);
        // .awesomeRxStuff();
}
```

The presenter `AvengerDetailPresenter` will be our `Observer` for this usecase will be who subscribes to the events sent by the `Observable`, this is done through the method `subscribe`, which connects the `Observer` with the `Observable`.

`onNext` and `onError` methods are implemented to manage the results of the operation. The `onCompleted` method is not implemented in this case it's not necessary.

```
    mCharacterSubscription = mGetCharacterInformationUsecase
        .execute().subscribe(
            character   -> onAvengerReceived(character),
            error       -> manageError(error));
```

<br>
## Retrofit & RxJava

[Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit) from [Square](http://square.github.io/), [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) supports methods of the type `rx. Observable` so the requests can be observed using `Observers` and modified and transformed by operators.

You must be aware of where are you calling it, [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit) executes the requests in the thread where your `Observable` leaves, so if you call it from the UI thread (an activity or Fragment) would get an error. Let's talk about `Schedulers`!.

## Schedulers

The [http://reactivex.io/documentation/scheduler.html](Schedulers) allow to use _multhreading_ between operators and `Observables`. This can be used with  different threads, a Thread Executor, or preset [Schedulers](http://reactivex.io/documentation/scheduler.html), for example, for input and output operations exists the `Schedulers.io ()`.

[RxAndroid](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxAndroid) are a few specific android utilities for [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) by [Jake Wharton](http://jakewharton.com/) & [Matthias KÃ¤ppler](https://plus.google.com/u/0/+MatthiasK%C3%A4ppler/posts), which includes some [Schedulers](http://reactivex.io/documentation/scheduler.html) to manage the threads of the Android platform. 

It also provides the possibility of using an android `Handler` for concurrency management.

```java
    @Override
    public Observable<Character> execute() {

        return mRepository.getCharacter(mCharacterId)
            .subscribeOn(Schedulers.newThread())
            .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread());
    }
```

This example demonstrates the ease provided by Rx for managing threads in Android, which has always been a terror to all :D

## Operators

[ReactiveX] great power lies in the operators, they allow to manipulate, transform and combine objects issued by the `Observables`.

Let's think about a list of comics of a character, comics have a specific year, and we want to show the comics to a given year. [ReactiveX] comes to help us!

This filtering is done use of operator [filter](http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/filter.html), which allows using a predicate to discriminate between the comics, in such a way, ask the user why year wants to filter and that year uses predicate to display comics to date.


```java
public Observable<Comic> filterByYear(String year) {

    if (mComics != null) {
        return Observable.from(mComics).filter(
            comic -> {
                for (ComicDate comicDate : comic.getDates())
                    if (comicDate.getDate().startsWith(year))
                        return true;

                return false;
        });

    }

    return null;
}
```


###Â Error Handling

Another great example of how the Rx operators can save us some time and give us productivity are the [error handling](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/wiki/Error-Handling-Operators) Operators.

Imagine that a user makes a request to the network, and coincidentally is on the bus or subway passing through tunnel, connectivity in that case will be affected.

When we receive a `SocketTimeoutException` by[Retrofit](http://square.github.io/retrofit/), what we will do will be to take advantage of the operator [retry](http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/retry.html#collapseRxJava).

The operator [retry](http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/retry.html#collapseRxJava) will accept a predicate as in the case of the operator ['filter'](http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/filter.html), if we return true in that predicate the magic of Rx will issue the 'Observable' again making the Retrofit request for us.

If as most 3 'SocketTimeoutExceptions' are fired, the program flow will go to the `onError` method to manage the error.

```java
@Override
public Observable<List<Comic>> getCharacterComics(int characterId) {

    final String comicsFormat   = "comic";
    final String comicsType     = "comic";

    return mMarvelApi.getCharacterComics(
        characterId, comicsFormat, comicsType)
            .retry((attemps, error) -> 
                error instanceof SocketTimeoutException && 
                attemps < MAX_ATTEMPS);
}
```
